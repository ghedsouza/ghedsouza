      <h1>Plugin Architecture in Python (aka Py3EE)</h1>
      <p>By <a href="/">Edward D'Souza</a> (June 21st, 2020)</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        When I came to Python from Java, I reveled in terseness and flexiblity.
        However, as I'm reading through "Clean Architecture" by Robert C.
        Martin, I'm seeing that some of the enterprisey ideas from Java are
        actually quite useful. In this artcle I look at how dependency direction
        and interfaces can be used to create a plugin architecture in Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        The toy example here might look over-engineered, but it lets us explore
        ideas that would be valuable in more realistic contexts when you have
        multiple people working together.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The example and many concepts are taken from "Clean Architecture".)

      <h2 id="example-problem">Example Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The example problem we'll use is that you're writing an encrypter
        program. It has to take in characters from stdin, encrypt them using a
        translation table, and write the output to stdout.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the easy part. The functional data-manipulation component that
        simply translates a character to its encrypted form using a shift
        cipher.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">def translate(char: str):
    shift = 1
    letters = string.ascii_lowercase
    if char in letters:
        return letters[(letters.index(char) + shift) % len(letters)]
    return char</code></pre>
      <h2 id="basic-solution">Basic Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a straight-forward solution to the full problem. It's probably
        what I would write by default when faced with the above requirements.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">import sys
from translate import translate

def encrypt():
    data = sys.stdin.readlines()
    for line in data:
        for char in line:
            print(translate(char))

encrypt()</code></pre>
      <p>
        The code is beautiful in its terseness, but has a few potential issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main problem is that it's mixing together several responsibilies:
        getting the characters, translation, and outputting the characters. If
        we had multiple people that wanted to modify those parts at the same
        time, it would be a mess getting everyone to work together in such a
        tight space.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a high-level policy, it also shouldn't be depending directly on
        low-level details like the "print" function.
      </p>
      <p>
        One strategy we can use to fix the above problems is to make the code
        work with generic interfaces. Specific implementations of those
        interfaces can then be plugged into the policy to create a working
        system. The policy is then decoupled from low-level details, and the
        code is organized so that the input and output concerns are nicely
        separated.
      </p>

      <p>Welcome to Py3EE.</p>
      <h3 id="policy">High-level Policy</h3>
      <pre><code class="language-python">import abc
from translate import translate


class CharReader(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def read_char(self):
        pass


class CharWriter(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def write_char(self, char: str):
        pass


def encrypter(reader: CharReader, writer: CharWriter):
    def encrypt():
        while True:
            try:
                char = reader.read_char()
            except StopIteration:
                break
            encrypted_char = translate(char)
            writer.write_char(encrypted_char)

    return encrypt</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now, we've clearly and explicitly spelled out the high-level policy of
        reading a character, encrypting it with the translate function, and
        writing out the encryped character.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm does not know or care about the stdin module or the print
        function. It remains open to be re-used in different contexts, with
        different input sources and output channels.
      </p>
      <h3 id="implementation">Enterprise Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        Admittedly, like a lot of enterprisey code, our policy is fairly verbose
        and doesn't actually do anything. To make it useful, we need to
        implement the CharReader and CharWriter interfaces and then plug them
        into the policy function.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">import sys
from enterprise import CharReader, CharWriter, encrypter


class MyCharReader(CharReader):
    def __init__(self):
        def get_characters():
            data = sys.stdin.readlines()
            for line in data:
                for char in line:
                    yield char

        self.iter = get_characters()

    def read_char(self):
        return next(self.iter)


class MyCharWriter(CharWriter):
    def write_char(self, char: str):
        print(char)


my_encrypter = encrypter(MyCharReader(), MyCharWriter())
my_encrypter()</code></pre>
      <p>
        What's cool is that the messiness of converting stdin into a stream of
        characters is contained within MyCharReader. No one else has to be
        burdened by it.
